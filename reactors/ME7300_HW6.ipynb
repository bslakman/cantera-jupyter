    "# Combustion and Air Pollution HW #6\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consider combustion of n-heptane ($C_7H_{16}$). Heptane and air are introduced to a constant volume chamber. First let's consider $\\phi$ = 1.0 and atmospheric pressure. Upon ignition, combustion of the premixed fuel/air occurs at constant volume and constant internal energy (assuming that the chamber is adiabatic).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculate:\n",
    "1. The adiabatic flame temperature if the fuel and air are preheated and introduced into the chamber at 500 K, for $\\phi$ = 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.3. Plot the result ( $T_{flame}$ vs $\\phi$ ) with Excel, or use Python if you are comfortable.\n",
    "2. The NO mole fraction at equlibrium for $\\phi$ = 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.3. Plot the result ( $x_{NO}$ vs $\\phi$ ) with Excel, or use Python if you are comfortable.\n",
    "3. The time at which the fuel ignites for $\\phi$ =  0.8, 1.0, and 1.3\n",
    "4. The time at which mole fraction of the fuel drops below 100 ppm for each $\\phi$\n",
    "5. At what time should we quench the reaction (by rapid expansion) if we want to keep NO emissions below 1000 ppm, for each $\\phi$? Is this before or after the time in part (4)?\n",
    "6. Also calculate 1-5 for the $\\phi$ = 1.0 case by hand / using STANJAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework we will use more detailed combustion chemistry then we previously considered in this class, along with the Zeldovich mechanism for thermal fixation of atmospheric N2, to model and predict NOx formation in heptane combustion.\n",
    "We use an open source software tool called [Cantera](http://www.cantera.org/docs/sphinx/html/index.html) which helps us solve thermodynamics and kinetics problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework was adapted from a lecture in Prof. Richard West's undergraduate chemical kinetics class in the Department of Chemical Engineering as well as existing Python notebooks in the [cantera-jupyter project](https://github.com/cantera/cantera-jupyter). \n",
